Focus on high-performing states – Virginia, Texas, and Washington show strong sales. Increase inventory, run targeted marketing, and offer region-specific promotions.

Boost sales in low-performing states – Vermont, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia lag behind. Conduct market research, offer attractive deals, and improve delivery logistics.

Optimize shipping strategies – Standard Class dominates orders. Improve efficiency, promote faster delivery during peak periods, and offer free upgrades for premium customers.

Expand high-performing products – Technology and Office Supplies lead sales. Introduce more products, promote top sub-categories, and create bundled offerings like “Work-from-Home Kits.”

Manage monthly profit fluctuations – Profit dips occur in certain months. Revisit discount strategies, use dynamic pricing, and reduce operational costs to maintain margins.
